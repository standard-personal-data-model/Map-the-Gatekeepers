# Map-the-Gatekeepers
Map Big-Tech takeout data to a common model so a person can transform their personal instance data into a common format.   

This project will:
1) Start with just one datum (i.e., 'email' for Google takeout data)
2) Map it to a common data model (creating a mapping file)
3) Draft a transformation script, which:
   a) Takes in the instance data [jdoe53403@gmail.com] and the mapping file, and
   b) Transforms it into RDF triples that conform to the common data model
